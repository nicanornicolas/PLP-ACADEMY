# --- Step 3: Demonstrate Polymorphism ---

# Create instances (objects) of each specific vehicle class.
my_car = Car("Toyota Camry")

# Create a list containing these different objects.
# Even though they are different types, they are all 'Vehicles'.
vehicles = [my_car, my_plane, my_boat, generic_vehicle]

# Now, we can loop through the list and call the SAME method (.move()) on each object.
# Python will automatically figure out which version of move() to run for each object.
# This is the essence of polymorphism!
